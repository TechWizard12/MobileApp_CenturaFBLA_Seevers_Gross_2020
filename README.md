# MobileApp_CenturaFBLA_Seevers_Gross_2020

Project description- Each chapter may submit entries created by an individual or team of two (2) or three (3) members in Grades 9 through 12.

The app must include a way to track chapter meeting attendance. The app must be designed for a phone/tablet. The operating system must be mobile based such as Android or iOS. The app should state its licensing and terms of use. This application is only in use for chapter officers and chapter sponsor not members.
